The following files contain the complete code to our project. This project was for our Database class where we had to demonstrate
our knowledge of using SQL queries to do an inventory application. Our project relates to inventory taken for gym that
need equipment for rent or purchase. The languages that were used to create the project are HTML, CSS, PHP, and SQL

To get this code to function properly on your machine or want to create a very similar project using parts of this code, whether you have Windows, MAC OS X, or Linux, the code should function properly
as long as you do the following:
1. Please install XAMPP on to your computer
	a. When you have installed XAMPP make sure that when you open up the XAMPP
	control panel and you will see "Apache" and MySQL" under Module. When you see this, it is very
	important that you click "Start" on "Apache" first, and then click "Start" on "MySQL" right after
	this is a MUST...remember, apache FIRST, then SQL
2. You should save the project within the "htdocs" of XAMPP file if you want to run the project locally on your computer,
this will generate localhost webpages for the html and php code/pages.
3. To view/run the code, you should install an open source code editor such as Brackets or Notepad++ this is how our project was
able to execute successfully
4. Use phpMyAdmin to create your database and tables
to view our table copy and paste this link: http://localhost/phpmyadmin/db_structure.php?db=powerhouse_warehouse
(make sure XAMPP is running to view)
